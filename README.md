## :books: General Info

* GraphCMS headless Content Management System (CMS) is used to create an API that can be accessed from the Next.js frontend using GraphQL
* Next.js is for server-rendered react apps. It has automatic code splitting, simple page-based routing, built-in CSS support and hot reloading. Every component file in the pages folder is treated as a page

## :camera: Screenshots

## :signal_strength: Technologies

* [Node.js v14](https://nodejs.org/) javascript runtime using the [Chrome V8 engine](https://v8.dev/).
* [React v17](https://reactjs.org/) Javascript library.
* [GraphQL v15](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
* [GraphQL Tag v2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tag) utilities for parsing GraphQL queries
* [Apollo v2](https://www.apollographql.com/) GraphQL implementation data graph layer
* [Apollo Client v3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-client) fully-featured caching GraphQL client

* [Next v11](https://nextjs.org/) minimalist framework for rendering react apps on the server.
* [Next with Apollo v5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-with-apollo)

## :floppy_disk: Setup

* `npm run dev` runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## :computer: Code Examples
